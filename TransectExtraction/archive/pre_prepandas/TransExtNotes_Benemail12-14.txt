# Ben's email:
*First Goal* => output file in form of "trans_clip2BND.shp" with following fields:
Most work needed on DH_zMHW, DL_zMHW, Dist_DH, Dist_DL, and DistToCana
^ = code (BreezyPt_ExtTransects) already provides this complete field

^OBJECTID
^Shape
^BaselineID
^TransOrder  - transect # from emily's shoreline change data
^ProcTime
^StartX      - starting point for each transect where it intersects and offshore baseline that is the reference point for emily's calculations
^StartY             - " "
^EndX              - " "
^EndY             - " "
^AZIMUTH      - orientation of the transects relative to North
^LRR          - shoreline change rate calculated by linear regression
^LR2          - R^2 of correlation between shoreline points
^LSE          - RMS error I think
^LCI90        - 90% confidence interval

Shape_Length  - length of transect......

DH_Lon         - position of dune crest height...we do both geographic and UTM coords
DH_Lat         - position of dune crest height
DH_easting     - position of dune crest height
DH_northing    - position of dune crest height
DH_z           -   height of dune crest relative to NAVD88
**DH_zMHW      -  *still need to add this field.* height of dune crest relative to MHW- Basically subtract 0.46 from DH_z

DL_Lon        - position of dune crest height...we do both geographic and UTM coords
DL_Lat        - " "
DL_easting    - " "
DL_northing   - " "
DL_z          - height of dune crest relative to NAVD88
**DL_zMHW     - *still need to add this field.*  height of dune crest relative to MHW- Basically subtract 0.46 from DL_z

WidthFull     - full length of transect across island end points
WidthLand     - length transect over land only
ShL_Lon       - Coordinates of MHW shoreline where it intersects transects
ShL_Lat       -  Coordinates of MHW shoreline where it intersects transects
ShL_easting    - ...."" UTM
ShL_northing    - ...."" UTM
Bslope          - slope of beach face from lidar data
beach_h_MLW       - beach height, vertical distance between dune toe and MLW intersect of beach topography
delta_xm_MLW      - horizontal width of beach
delta_x_gc_MLW    - width along a great circle (possibly in radians)
azimuth_SL        - orientation of transect used to sample beach slope in lidar dataset
MLW_Long          - extrapolated MLW coordinates
MLW_Lat           - extrapolated MLW coordinates
beachWdith_MLW    - horizontal width of beach

DistToCana            - distance to the inlet to the west side of Breezy Pt. The reference point should be the first transect on that side that intersects land.  This is a route following distance so it's the cumulative distance along the          shoreline as opposed to a straight-line distance from each transect (funny name comes from Aaron T. who referred to the inlet as a canal).

Dist_DH                  - distance between MHW position and position of dune crest height  (straight-line distance coincident with transect).
Dist_DL                  - distance between MHW position and position of dune toe

Emily's notes while working:
There are far too many fields in the starting transect shp (northing_1_12_13... craziness)
DistToCana still unsuccessful
DistDH and DistDL completed!


Goal 2:  sample elevations and slopes along the transects. Output for this is: tranSplitPts.shp which includes all the info in trans_clip2BND.shp  also.
....code set up to do this at Assateague and we can pull it in here.

seg_x                    - UTM X for each 5-m cell
seg_y                    - UTM Y for each 5-m cell
DistSeg                - distance to each 5 m cell from MHW
DistSegDH            - distance of each 5 m cell from DH position
DistSegDL            - disntace of each 5 m cell from DL position
PointZ                   - avg. elevation for each 5-m cell
PointSlp               - avg. slope for each 5-m cell (not able to do this as we need a slope grid for the site and I don't think sawyer made one yet).

Vegetation: for now, Sara has the vegetation and substrate layers under control and we're going to rely on her for those.

Inputs:  (in the geodatabase I gave you)

BreezyPt_extTransects.shp    - the extended transects for Breezy point. Have shoreline change info associated with them already
BreezyBoundsPGon.shp    - the Breezy point boundary comprised of ocean side and bayside shorelines

BreezyPoint2014_FullShoreline.shp -
DHigh_BP_edited.shp  - the Dhigh positions - I have edited out those that do not coincide with a dune layer that sara made
DLow_BP edited.shp  - ditto for Dlow
Elev2015_MHW     - elevation grid for Breezy Point

Ocean_MHW_2014.shp
SLPs    - shoreline positons and slopes derived from: BreezyPoint2014_FullShoreline.shp
